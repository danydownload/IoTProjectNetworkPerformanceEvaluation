# IoT Project Network Performance Evaluation

This project was created for the "IoT" class exam at UNIMORE university by Daniele Tortoli. The aim of this project is to evaluate the network performance of WiFi and Bluetooth for the ESP32 microcontroller.

The repository is divided into four branches:

- WiFi_Client
- WiFi_Server
- BT_Client
- BT_Server

Each branch contains the necessary code and files to evaluate the network performance of the corresponding technology.

## WiFi_Client

This branch contains the code and files for the WiFi client.

## WiFi_Server

This branch contains the code and files for the WiFi server.

## BT_Client

This branch contains the code and files for the Bluetooth client.

## BT_Server

This branch contains the code and files for the Bluetooth server.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and checkout the desired branch for the technology you want to evaluate.
